	To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard 
him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and 
predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion 
akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, 
were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I 
take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world 
has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. 
He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They 
were admirable things for the observer—excellent for drawing the veil from 
men’s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such 
intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to 
introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his 
mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his 
own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion 
in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that 
woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.
